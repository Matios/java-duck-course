     class 6
Default value for instance variabels is zero for int and for double is 0.00, and null for string when 
we assign it to an object.
we don't need to write an object referance to acesses static variabels.
static means in java single copy will share for every instance.
final in java is mean it will not change at all.
default variabels we can only access it inside same package.
public everywhere.
protected we need a relationship between class to accss it.
Eg:- like inheritance.
private only that class.
so, if package is different then the class member (a  protected variable or a protected method/function) 
can be accessed by only subclass objects
